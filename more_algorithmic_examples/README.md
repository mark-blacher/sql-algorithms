# Supplement for the paper - Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, and More: Is SQL All You Need?


## Additional SQL-Only Algorithmic Examples
This folder contains three advanced algorithms implemented in Python, along with their SQL adaptations. Specifically, the code demonstrates matrix inversion, solving least squares problems, and performing softmax regression.
These algorithms were not included in the paper.

## Requirements
See [requirements](../README.md#Requirements) of the whole repository.  

## Usage
The SQL scripts can be executed using PostgreSQL. Note that the `inverse_hyper.sql` script requires the Tableau Hyper API.
